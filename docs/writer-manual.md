# writer manual

*日本語版(secondary): [writer-manual.ja.md](writer-manual.ja.md)*

A word processor that opens, edits, and saves docx. It exports PDF and can read
JavaScript-free HTML as a document. **Ribbon: 114/114 — every button works
(zero grayed out).**

Three promises:

- **Formatting is preserved.** Styles, shapes, and parts we don't understand
  survive a save untouched (carried over from the original file)
- **Every operation is one undo away.** Keystrokes, IME commits, pastes, a single
  ink stroke, a color-scheme change — all come back with one Ctrl+Z
- **Nothing is dropped silently.** Anything we can't read, or that would be lost
  on save, is listed in the report and mentioned in the status bar

Try the samples in [sample/](../sample/README.md) — especially
`sample/writer/01〜05` (Japanese typesetting, vertical writing, an application
form, a monthly report, a feature tour).

## Starting

```bash
./target/release/writer                          # opens empty
./target/release/writer sample/報告書.docx
./target/release/writer sample/writer/02_縦書きの手紙.docx
```

If the machine has no Japanese font, the app stops and says so (instead of showing
tofu boxes). Install `fonts-noto-cjk` or `fonts-ipaexfont`, or set `OFFICE_FONT=…`.

## The screen

The window frame follows the desktop-app convention. **Row 1**: save, print, undo,
redo, and the document name (unsaved changes show a `*`; this row is also the
window drag handle). **Row 2**: tabs on a white strip (the current tab is
underlined; the 🔍 at the right edge is find & replace). **Bottom edge**: the
status bar — page n/m, character count (character, not word, count — matching
how Japanese documents are measured), status messages, proofreading, zoom.

- **The File tab is a full-page view** — a menu on the left (New, Open, Open URL,
  12 recent files, Save, Save As, Print, Protect, Properties, Open file location,
  Quit) and "Document info" on the right (statistics plus docx properties =
  author, title, and so on; click a field and type — it goes into docProps and
  is visible in Word)
- **Left panel** (View tab): headings / comments / search — click to jump
- **Right panel** (View tab): settings board for character, paragraph, and page —
  the buttons are the same actions as the ribbon; active toggles are tinted

Tab order:
**File / Home / Insert / Draw / Layout / References / Forms /
Header & Footer / Collaboration / Protection / View / Plugins**.

## Basic keys

| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| Move | ↑ ↓ ← → (visual lines). By word: Ctrl+←→ |
| Line start / end | Home / End (Home twice = paragraph start) |
| Document start / end | Ctrl+Home / Ctrl+End |
| Select | Shift+arrows, Ctrl+A |
| Undo / redo | Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z (Ctrl+Y too) |
| Copy / cut / paste | Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V |
| Find / replace | Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H |
| Open / save | Ctrl+O / Ctrl+S |
| Indent / list level | Tab / Shift+Tab (inside a table: next cell) |
| Context menu | Menu key / Shift+F10 |
| Close dialog, put tool away | Esc |
| Quit | Ctrl+Q (asks if there are unsaved changes) |

Uncommitted IME text appears underlined in the body and becomes one undo step
when committed. New features (ruby, vertical writing, …) are all reachable from
buttons — there are no new shortcuts to memorize.

## Character formatting (Home)

**Applies to the selected text only** (with no selection, to the whole paragraph).
Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, super/subscript, text color, highlight,
font (from this machine's font list), size, change case, clear formatting.

**Ruby (furigana)**: select text, Home > Ruby, type the reading in the dialog
(empty removes it). It is set at half size above the base text; if the reading is
longer than the base, spacing is distributed. Stored as `w:ruby` in docx and
visible in Word / LibreOffice. Denden-markdown `{漢字|かんじ}` in .md files is
also read.

## Paragraph formatting (Home)

- Alignment: left, center, right, justified, and **distributed** — unlike
  justified, it spreads spacing **through the last line** (the shape used for
  labels that must fill the column in Japanese forms; stored as `w:jc distribute`)
- Bulleted and numbered lists (levels via Tab / Shift+Tab), indent, line spacing
  (1.0→1.5→2.0), page-break-before, background color, borders, drop caps
- Toggle display of hidden characters

## Vertical writing (Home > Text Direction)

Each press toggles horizontal/vertical. Text flows top-to-bottom, columns
right-to-left; punctuation, brackets, and long-vowel marks switch to their
vertical forms, and ruby works vertically too. Stored as `textDirection tbRl`
in sectPr; verified to open in LibreOffice.

Honest first-version limits: tables and multi-column layout stay horizontal;
Latin letters and digits are stacked one per line (no rotated run yet); explicit
page breaks fold into column breaks. Not combined with facing-pages view.
Sample: `sample/writer/02_縦書きの手紙.docx`.

## Headings, TOC, bookmarks, cross-references (References)

- **Headings**: Home > paragraph styles (or References > Add Text to cycle
  body → heading 1 → 2 → 3)
- **TOC / table of figures**: page numbers are computed with **the same layout
  as print (PDF)**, so they can't disagree with the paper. After edits, press
  Update to rebuild. Stored in docx as static text
- **Captions**: "図 N" below the paragraph, numbered automatically
- **Bookmarks**: add/remove/jump from a dialog. **Cross-references** insert a
  bookmark's text or page number into the body (shown with a light shade =
  computed value; stored as REF / PAGEREF fields, so Word can recalculate them)

## Forms (form fields / content controls)

Ten kinds on the Forms tab: **text, combo box, dropdown, checkbox, radio,
picture, e-mail, phone, composite, signature**.

- Fields appear as light boxes; typing inside them works normally (the content
  stays part of the field)
- Checkboxes toggle ☐⇄☑ with the same button (or the space key). Combo/dropdown
  choices are set comma-separated in a dialog; the same button cycles candidates
- Stored as `w:sdt` (content controls) and opens in Word. Our own kinds
  (e-mail, phone, composite, signature) are tagged `jo:*`
- **Combined with Protection > Protect this becomes a distributable form** —
  hand out a read-only document where only the fields accept input. Sample:
  `sample/writer/03_申込書.docx`

## Tables, images, insert

- **Tables**: Insert > Table (3×3). Edit inside cells, Tab to the next cell.
  Tables with merged cells are read, displayed, saved, and printed (no UI to
  create new merges yet)
- **Images**: PNG, JPEG, SVG (SVG is converted to a high-resolution PNG).
  Saved as proper docx parts, visible in Word
- **Shapes, SmartArt (9 layouts), charts, text art**:
  behind the buttons Python (matplotlib etc.) draws the picture and pastes it
  as an image
- **Equations**: Insert > Equation opens a small panel — **type LaTeX and
  press Enter** (e.g. `\frac{a+b}{2}`). Python typesets it: with TeX
  installed it typesets there (matrix columns align), otherwise matplotlib.
  **The picture and the LaTeX source go into the docx as a pair**, so Word
  shows the picture and writer reopens it as an editable formula. A formula
  it cannot set is refused with the reason
- **Text box**: a 1×1 table (text inside a frame)
- **Text from file**: inserts .txt / .md / .docx

## Drawing (pen, highlighter, eraser)

Drag on the page. Strokes are **anchored to the page** (editing the body doesn't
move them); one stroke is one undo step. In docx they become freeform shapes,
visible in Word.

## Layout

- Paper (A4→B5→A3), orientation, margins (20/12/30mm), columns (1→2→3),
  line numbers, page color, watermark (light diagonal text, visible in Word),
  hyphenation (Latin text broken at syllables)
- **Color scheme**: cycles through six (standard, indigo, green, dark red,
  indigo+unbleached paper, ink+gray paper). Heading color and page color change
  as a pair, and the **actual color values are written**, so Word shows the same
  colors without needing theme parts. One Ctrl+Z restores

## Header & footer

Edited in a dialog (shared by all pages). Page number and page count go in as
placeholders and become real numbers on paper (PDF). The date is inserted as
**fixed text** at insertion time (not a field that changes every time the file
is opened — a classic source of clerical accidents).

## HTML — reading and filling in, without JavaScript

**Read, fill in, and print web documents in writer.**

- **Open**: an .html file, or File > **Open URL** (http/https). Headings,
  paragraphs, lists, tables, images, ruby, and forms are typeset onto the page —
  unreadable elements go to the report. Links are followed **only within the
  origin host**
- **JavaScript is never executed** (it is skipped and noted in the report).
  Pages that require JS won't work — and the app says so
- **Filling and submitting**: form fields (input / select / textarea) become
  form fields; submit is a plain GET / POST round trip. The response becomes
  a page again
- **In-page Python** (`<script type="py">`) is **never run on open**. It runs
  only on explicit command, inside the same sandbox as Python in Calc
- Opened HTML can be saved as docx and printed as PDF (we don't save HTML —
  compatibility stops at the format boundary)
- Acceptance samples: `sample/html/` (01〜10); a live counterpart is the catalog
  and order form from `python3 sample/catalog_server.py`

## Collaboration tab — no server, everything through files

Tools that work on a document in a shared folder:

- **Collaboration mode**: checks who holds the lock (`.~lock.document.docx#`),
  by name; if the previous holder has left, takes over editing rights. While
  someone else holds it, overwrite-save is blocked (first come, first served;
  later arrivals read — an honest arrangement)
- **Comments**: add/remove/toggle per paragraph (docx comments.xml; Word shows
  them as balloons)
- **Track changes**: start/stop recording. While recording, changed paragraphs
  get an orange bar in the margin. **On save** they become real Word tracked
  changes (insertions/deletions with author). Saving finalizes the recording
  (the app tells you so)
- **Chat**: appends named messages to a file next to the document
  (`document.docx.chat.txt`). Not live — messages passed through files
- **Version history**: every overwrite-save keeps a copy under `.jo-history/`
  (9 generations). Selecting one opens it as an **untitled copy** — to restore,
  save it yourself under the same name (nothing is written back silently)

## Protection tab

- **Protect**: read-only toggle (round-trips docx documentProtection — Word
  shows it as protected too). **No password, and no pretend-password.** The
  effect is real: typing and every document-changing button are blocked;
  viewing, printing, and searching still work
- **Encrypt**: set a password and the next save is wrapped in AES
  (**Agile = AES-256, the Word 2013+ default**; opening also accepts the older
  AES-128). Opens in Word / LibreOffice. Clear the field and press Enter to
  remove. Cross-verified against msoffcrypto-tool
- **Digital signature**: a signature file next to the document
  (`document.docx.sig`, Ed25519; the key is auto-generated at
  `~/.config/office/sign.key`). Tamper detection plus a name — it is not the
  scheme that fills Word's signature line (and says so)

## View tab

Navigation (left panel), fit page / fit width / 100% / zoom in / out,
**print layout (sheets stacked one page at a time — the view where a
document whose sections change paper size shows the difference; the editing
view stays one continuous scroll)**,
**multiple pages (spread — screen only; printing stays one page per sheet)**,
dark mode (surroundings darken, paper stays white), ruler (mm),
toolbar / status bar / side panel toggles.

## Proofreading (review)

English spelling via the machine's dictionary; Japanese misconversions
(以外/意外) and inconsistent spellings via a **local model** (OpenAI-compatible
endpoint, `OFFICE_HOST` / `OFFICE_PORT` / `OFFICE_MODEL`; nothing leaves your
network). Model hallucinations are filtered, and **if the model can't be
reached the app says "can't proofread"** — never a silent "no issues".
Automatic furigana uses the same model assets (readings chosen in context,
based on measurements of 561 ambiguous-reading words).

Headless tools: `office-spell document.txt` (exit code 0=clean 1=findings
2=unreadable 3=incomplete), `--furigana`, `--washi`.

## Plugins tab

- **Macros**: choose a .py and **Python in a sandbox** (bubblewrap) edits a copy
  of the document; the result lands as one undo step. The script gets `d` =
  the python-docx Document. **Code is never stored in the document** (no
  executable content in docx — the policy differs from xlsx because python-docx
  already exists as public infrastructure)
- **Manage plugins**: lists and runs .py files from `~/.config/office/plugins`
  (in the sandbox). Extensions like Aozora annotations or EPUB go here
- **Writing macros** — named fields (`fill`/`extract`), templates (`render`),
  speed rules, and the AI button: see the
  [writer macro manual](writer-macro-manual.md)

## Printing (PDF) and saving

- File > Print writes a PDF. **Screen and paper are the same page** — they
  cannot disagree. Real header/footer numbers, watermark, page color, ink,
  and vertical writing all carry over
- Ctrl+S saves docx (blocked if someone else holds the lock). Body, tables,
  images, and headers are written back; parts we don't understand are carried
  over from the original file. Elements we couldn't read are noted as
  "preserved on save"

## No more gray

All 114 ribbon commands work. The gray of "don't make it look usable when it
isn't" reached **zero** in writer (2026-08-04). The remaining honest limits are
noted in each section above (first-version vertical writing, per-change
accept/reject for tracked changes, no UI yet for creating cell merges).
